Welcome to **Root Defence** — a simple Tower Defense game built using C++ and SDL2.

 This project started as a personal test to explore game development basics. It's not meant to be a full-scale or polished game—just something I made to try things out, learn a bit, and have some fun with game development.

Feel free to browse the code, fork it, or use any part of it if it helps you in your own projects. Just keep in mind: this repo wasn’t created as a "best practices" example, just me tinkering.
